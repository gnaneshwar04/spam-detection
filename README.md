# üìß Spam Detection using SVM

This project implements a **Spam Detection System** using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm. It processes SMS messages to classify them as either **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning.

## üîç Problem Statement

With the rising volume of text-based communication, spam messages have become a growing concern. Manually identifying spam is inefficient and error-prone. The goal is to build an automated system that accurately classifies SMS messages as spam or ham.

---

## ‚úÖ Proposed Solution

The system uses a machine learning approach with the following steps:
- Load and clean the SMS dataset
- Preprocess text using NLP techniques
- Extract features using **TF-IDF vectorization**
- Train an **SVM model** on the processed data
- Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
